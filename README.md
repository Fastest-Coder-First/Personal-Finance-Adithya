# Personal-Finance-Tracker

This is a personal finance tracker that I built using GitHub copilot. It helped me add functionalities, and helped me make sure that the page is dynamic. The functions and event listeners in the script, were all made by GitHub copilot. The HTML page and the styles were also made with the help of copilot, even though I also worked to change some things. The demo of the project shows the functionalities present in the application.

# Architecture Flow
1. User Interface (UI):
The UI layer consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code responsible for presenting the web page to the user and capturing user interactions.
It defines the structure, style, and behavior of the user interface, allowing users to input transaction details, perform actions, and view transaction data.

2. Client-Side JavaScript:
The client-side JavaScript code handles the logic and functionality of the Transaction Tracker application.
It interacts with the UI elements, captures user input, and performs operations based on user actions.
The JavaScript code validates user input, manages transaction data, calculates summary information, and updates the UI accordingly.
It utilizes the Chart.js library for rendering the transaction chart.

3. Data Management:
Transaction data is managed within the client-side JavaScript code.
The data is stored in memory variables or local storage, depending on the desired persistence level.
The JavaScript code provides functionalities for adding, deleting, sorting, and filtering transactions, as well as calculating summary information.

4. External Dependencies:
The Transaction Tracker project includes external dependencies such as the Chart.js library for rendering the transaction chart.
These dependencies are included in the project through the use of external JavaScript and CSS files.
